# S3 Microservice Integration Guide

## 🎯 Integration Summary

The incident file upload system has been successfully integrated with the Render S3 microservice. When users upload files through the `IncidentUserTasks.vue` component, files are now automatically uploaded to AWS S3 via the Render microservice.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. Modified FileUploadView (`incident_views.py`)
- Replaced the old S3Client with RenderS3Client from `s3_functions.py`
- Enhanced error handling for microservice integration
- Added MySQL database tracking for all file operations
- Updated response format to match Vue component expectations

### 2. Added Helper Functions
- `get_s3_client()`: Creates S3 client with error handling
- `test_s3_integration()`: New endpoint to verify integration status

### 3. Enhanced URLs (`urls.py`)
- Added test endpoint: `/api/test-s3-integration/`

## 🚀 How to Test the Integration

### 1. Test the Integration Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/test-s3-integration/
```

### 2. Run the Test Script
```bash
cd backend
python test_s3_integration.py
```

### 3. Test File Upload in Vue Component
1. Open IncidentUserTasks.vue in your browser
2. Select a user and incident
3. Upload a file in the mitigation workflow
4. Verify the file gets an S3 URL

## 📊 File Upload Flow

```
Vue Component Upload

## 🔍 Response Format

The Vue component now receives this enhanced response:

```json

  "success": true,
  "file_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/file.pdf",
  "aws-file_link": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/file.pdf",
  "fileName": "original_name.pdf",
  "stored_name": "incident_123_mitigation_1_secure_name.pdf",
  "operation_id": 42,
  "platform": "Render"
}
```

## 🛠️ Key Features

- ✅ Security validation (file type, size, malware scanning)
- ✅ Render microservice integration
- ✅ AWS S3 storage
- ✅ MySQL operation tracking
- ✅ Error handling and fallback
- ✅ Vue component compatibility

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Make sure these environment variables are set:
```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_NAME=grc
DB_PORT=3306
```
